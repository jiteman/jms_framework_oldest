/**
 * Provides a non-STL alternative to the STL map<unsigned long, unsigned long>
 * which maps character codes to glyph indices inside FTCharmap.
 *
 * Implementation:
 *   - NumberOfBuckets buckets are considered.
 *   - Each bucket has BucketSize entries.
 *   - When the glyph index for the character code C has to be stored, the
 *     bucket this character belongs to is found using 'C div BucketSize'.
 *     If this bucket has not been allocated yet, do it now.
 *     The entry in the bucked is found using 'C mod BucketSize'.
 *     If it is set to IndexNotFound, then the glyph entry has not been set.
 *   - Try to mimic the calls made to the STL map API.
 *
 * Caveats:
 *   - The glyph index is now a signed long instead of unsigned long, so
 *     the special value IndexNotFound (= -1) can be used to specify that the
 *     glyph index has not been stored yet.
